            <h5 class="BigCaslon25">The Lemon Tree & Co. Imperial Boat Zamalek </h5>
            <p style="width: 90%;margin: 0 auto;">Once upon a tree, a magic seed was planted in
                the midst of Egypt's chaos in 2014. It was the
                time where hospitality suffered the post-
                revolution. Nevertheless, it was the
                beginning of something new and bright; The
                Lemon Tree & Co. Zamalek Restaurant and
                Bar rose tall in Cairo with a magnificent Nile
                view. Although many people thought that The
                Lemon Tree & Co. was a franchise obtained
                from abroad; we took pride in starting our
                very own fully Egyptian brand in the fine
                hospitality industry.

                at the North Coast - The Beach Bar by The
                Lemon Tree & Co. It was the go-to, classy

                best for its soothing Mediterranean
                ambiance, its extensive seasonal menu and
                Its uplifting music, all whilst overlooking a

                opened the doors of The Lemon Tree & Co.
                Marassi, which brought together the best of
                hospitality and entertainment. It was known
                for its spectacular events during the
                weekends and its sumptuous Mediterranean
                cuisine all summer round. From then on, The
                Lemon Tree & Co. Marasst had become the
                most favoured nightlife experience at the
                North Coast, offering our guests a 'Family &
                Friends' party every Saturday night. It was
                the time and place where guests engaged
                their every sense without a moment of
                dullness.

                take our guests on an exclusive surprise
                dinner or party. Combining mystery and
                extravagance, Club clandestine carefully
                plans everything beforehand in secrecy and
                style; from the invitation and the
                transportation, to delivering a series of
                extraordinary experiences.

            <p style="width: 90%;margin: 0 auto;">It all started with our beloved friends and
                family; where we would unite together for
                the love of music. Talented artists from all
                around the world would produce and
                exclusively share their music with us, hence
                making this brand come to life. The concept
                of 'Family & Friends' was introduced at The
                Lemon Tree & Co. Marassi by creating
                remarkable experiences, where nights
                turned into mornings and friends turned into
                family. It has become an ever-growing
                nightlife brand, offering distinctive music
                and ever-lasting energy.

                for one season; it was an oriental-inspired
                restaurant located by the Nile, offering its
                guests a rich menu of delicacies. It was a
                season of transition for The Lemon Tree &
                Co., a moment where the tree had decided to
                migrate somewhere else, grounding its roots
                at The Lemon Tree & Co. Katameya and
                ending its journey at The Lemon Tree & Co.
                Zamalek. This is what we call a healthy
                transition, a new beginning and yet another
                milestone of our ever-growing tree.

                already started creating our very own array
                of décor items and elegant furnishings for
                our Restaurants, Bars and Beach clubs. All
                our pieces and accents were hand-crafted
                and designed by our talented team of
                artisans. Our pieces and décor left our guests
                in awe, hence raising a lot of questions of
                where they're from and if they can be
                purchased. Since then, the brand has
                evolved; becoming 'Can Limón'. Our very first
                concept store is located at Rituals in the
                North Coast; although the brand is now
                evolving regionally and globally; where Can
                Limon will soon open its doors at El Gouna,
                Cairo, Greece and Ibiza Town.
